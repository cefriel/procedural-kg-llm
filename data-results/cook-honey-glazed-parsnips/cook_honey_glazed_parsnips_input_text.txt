How to Cook Honey Glazed Parsnips 
For those who don't want plain vegetables, try this to give your taste buds a reawakening,
and make them dance with delight. Here is how to make yummy honey glazed parsnips 
(a root crop/tuber). Enjoy them hot or cold. Preheat oven to 160 C (320â„‰) degrees, 
for 15 minutes prior to cooking time. Grease the roasting tray. 
Or, line it with aluminum foil, to keep juices from burning onto the pan. 
Brush and wash parsnips. Remove the tops about 6mm (1/4 inch), with the leafy part, and trim off any 
roots/and the very tip. Slice the parsnips lengthwise: 
Most are shaped like carrots, but some are bulbous like turnips 
(either kind is creamy white but may have a purplish skin). 
Put the slices in the center of the wire rack in a roasting tray. Add other selected 
vegetables that you have cut into chunks. Spread other vegetables if desired around 
the parsnips on the wire rack that is in the roasting tray. Bake.
