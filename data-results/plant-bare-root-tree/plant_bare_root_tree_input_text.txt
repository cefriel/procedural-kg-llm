how to plant a bare root tree 
Planting bare root trees is a fun and economical way to have lush green trees on your property without the higher cost of purchasing established trees. 
By following these easy steps, you can turn your brown thumb into a green thumb in no time. 
Carefully unpack the bare root tree from the container or material it came in. 
Be careful not to damage any of the roots during the unpacking process. 
If you do damage a few, nip them off with a pair of sterilized pruners.
Set the tree into a bucket filled with water. 
Allow the tree to soak for 4-6 hours prior to planting. 
This will allow the roots of the tree to soak up water and not dry out during the initial shock of planting.  
Dig a hole slightly larger than the diameter and depth of the tree and soil width.
