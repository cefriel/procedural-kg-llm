    "title_description": "Knowing how to fix a rubbing door is an essential tool for making minor home repairs. Doors can rub for a variety of reasons, which may include foundations shifting and settling to newly installed flooring bumping the doors. A rubbing door can cause damage to the paint and varnish to a door or doorjamb, as well as mark up flooring or cause carpeting to bunch up. A door that rubs may also be difficult to close and may be pushed open easily. Learn how to fix a rubbing door yourself, and you can avoid calling an expensive carpenter or repair person.",
