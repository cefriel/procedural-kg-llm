      "3. In step 3, the activity \"put\" is correctly extracted, but the direct object \"pressure\" should be plural to match the original sentence. So, it should be \"gently put upward pressure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. In step 4, the direct object \"lifting the door\" is correctly extracted, but it would be clearer to rephrase it as \"check if lifting the door relieves the rubbing issue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. In step 6, there are two direct objects extracted, \"door\" and \"doorjamb.\" To improve clarity, it should be \"examine the door and the doorjamb to determine where the door is rubbing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. In step 7, the equipment \"stepladder\" is correctly extracted, but it would be clearer to specify its usage. So, it should be \"use a stepladder to look for worn away paint on the door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7. In step 8, the equipment \"carpet\" and \"floor\" are correctly extracted, but it would be clearer to specify their usage. So, it should be \"swing the door back and forth to check if it rubs against the carpet or makes marks on the floor.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "9. In step 10, the equipment \"narrow screwdriver,\" \"awl,\" and \"hammer\" are correctly extracted, but it would be clearer to specify their usage. So, it should be \"remove the door from its hinges using a narrow screwdriver or awl and hammer.\"\n",
