The manufacturer and model number are usually located on the edge of the door frame either on the sides or the bottom below the dishwasher door. Locate the owner's manual online at the manufacturer's website or call their customer service line for assistance. Locate the filter by referencing your machine's owner's manual. Dishwasher filters are typically located near the bottom of the machine or the lower spray arm. Follow the directions in the owner's manual to remove the filter. Throw away any larger pieces of debris, and rinse out the filter. Reattach filter.\n",

    "How to Install a Ceiling Fan\n",
    "Having a ceiling fan in your home is a great way to keep the whole room cool without the costs of running an air conditioner all day. Although it might seem like a formidable task when you’re just starting out, it's easy to replace an old lighting fixture with a new ceiling fan if you know the right way to do it. By breaking the process into steps and knowing how to work safely with electricity, you can turn a fan kit into a working fan in less than a day.\n",
    "Removing the Old Fixture\n",
    "Turn the electricity off at the circuit breaker box.\n",
    "When working with electricity or wiring, you should always cut power to the area before you touch anything else. Locate the circuit breaker box in your home and turn off the power to the room or area your fan will be installed in. Some homes will have multiple breaker boxes, with one main and several sub-breaker boxes in different places. If you have multiple breaker boxes, turn off power at the sub-breaker box and the main box before beginning work.\n",
    "Remove any screws holding the old fixture in place.\n",
    "Use a ladder or step-ladder to safely climb up towards the roof to give you access the fixtures. Hold the fixture in place with one hand as you remove any screws securing it to the roof. Once they have been taken out, the old fixture should be able to detach from the ceiling. If there is no fitting where you want to install your new ceiling fan, you should call a licensed electrician to install one for you. You will need to run wiring through your walls, which is very difficult to do and can be very dangerous if done wrong. If you cannot hold the fixture in place while you remove the screws, get somebody else to help. This will reduce the chance of the fixture falling from the ceiling and make it easier to unscrew.\n",
    "Disconnect the wires from the old electrical fixture.\n",
    "Locate the point where the wires from the fixture are held to the wires coming from the ceiling with plastic connectors. Ensure the fixture is supported by something other than the wires and begin unscrewing and removing each plastic connector. Once disconnected, lower the fixture from your ceiling and discard it or store it somewhere safe for future use. Do not cut any wires or attempt to rewire anything in your ceiling without help from a licensed electrician. If the wiring is different than you anticipated, stop immediately and call a professional to help. Always make sure something is supporting any fixtures you remove or install as you work on them. Don't let the fixture be held up only by wires, as this may damage them. Ask a friend to help if you need them.\n",
    "Remove the old ceiling box.\n",
    "The ceiling box is a circular metal fitting that other fixtures attach to. Look for any screws or nails holding the old ceiling box in place and remove them. Push the circuit box further into the ceiling, or attempt to pry it out to remove it. If you can access the space above the ceiling box and get a better look at it, it may be easier to remove. If not, use a flashlight to look at it from below and work out the easiest way to remove it. Few standard ceiling boxes will be sturdy enough to hold the weight of a spinning ceiling fan. You shouldn’t use the existing ceiling box unless you are absolutely certain it is rated for a ceiling fan. If you're unsure, remove it and replace it with a new ceiling box that has a weight rating above the weight of your ceiling fan. Ask at your local hardware store or look online to find one that will be strong enough. If you're unsure whether or not your ceiling box will be able to hold your fan, look inside it for any markings or model numbers that will help identify it. Look online or ask at your local hardware store to make sure that the weight rating for your box is more than the weight of your fan. Some ceiling boxes will have cable clamps that secure the wiring in place. If you notice a metal fixture tightly holding the wiring, look for a screw on the fixture's side. Loosen this screw and slip the cable clamp over the end of the wiring to remove it.\n",
    "Attaching the New Ceiling Box\n",
    "Purchase a fan box with a hanger bar if the fixture is between two ceiling joists.\n",
    "A hanger bar is an extendable rod that will hold taut between two ceiling joists and give you something to attach the fan to. Purchase a fan box with a hanger bar from your local electrical store and use this if your fan will be installed between two ceiling joists. Use a small flashlight to look into the hole in your ceiling where your new ceiling box will be installed. If you don't see a long piece of wood directly above the hole, it is likely your ceiling box is being installed between two joists. Locate the studs in your ceiling to be sure.\n",
    "Choose a screw-fastening fan box if you have access to a single ceiling joist.\n",
    "If the opening in your ceiling is directly below some wooden framing, use a fan box that can be screwed directly into the framing. Purchase a fan box without a hanger bar from your local hardware or electronics store. Look through the hole where you will be installing your ceiling box for a wooden joist directly above the hole. If you can easily screw something into the joist, use a screw-fastening fan box.\n",
    "Cut around the hole to make sure it is the right size.\n",
    "A fan rated ceiling box may be bigger or slightly thicker than a standard ceiling box. Hold the fan box up to the hole and trace around it with a pencil. Use a drywall saw to cut away excess ceiling until the fan box will fit in. Be careful when cutting not to saw through any wiring in the ceiling. Keep the saw as shallow as possible to prevent hitting anything unintended.\n",
    "Feed the cables through the new electrical box.\n",
    "Lift the new ceiling box towards and into the ceiling. As you do so, thread the wiring coming from the ceiling through the central hole in the ceiling box. If the fan box comes with a cable clamp, thread the wiring through this as well. Push it over the wires until it sits on the face of the fan box, and tighten the screws on the cable clamp to hold the wires in place.\n",
    "Secure the fan-rated ceiling box in place.\n",
    "If you have a fan box that attaches directly to a ceiling joist, hold the box against the joist and use the provided screws to fasten it in place. If you need a hanger bar, position the bar between the two joists. Use an adjustable wrench to rotate the bar and extend it, rotating until the bar is held securely in place between the two joists. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to attach the fan box to the hanger bar.\n",
    "Attach the ceiling plate or bracket.\n",
    "The ceiling plate or fan bracket is the fixture that your fan will be suspended from. Hold the ceiling plate up to the fan box and pull all of the wires through the hole in its center. Use the provided screws to tightly secure the ceiling plate in place. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions when working with specific parts. The method for attaching ceiling plates and brackets may vary, but it needs to be done correctly to keep the fan attached to the ceiling. If you have a ceiling medallion or any molding to go around the fitting, attach it now. This will be a decorative piece that surrounds the fitting and is secured to the roof. Use a small amount of urethane-based adhesive to hold it to the roof, before securing it in place with four finishing nails. For a better-finished appearance, cover the nail holes with caulk or spackle.\n",
    "Assembling the Ceiling Fan\n",
    "Purchase a fan kit.\n",
    "This will contain all of the parts you need to assemble and mount a new ceiling fan. Fan kits should be available from your local hardware store, as well as online.Make sure to buy a fan that fits the size of the room where it will be installed. Use a 36 in (91 cm) fan for a room less than 144 square feet (13.4 m)\\nOpt for a 42 in (110 cm) fan for a room between 144 square feet (13.4 m) and 225 square feet (20.9 m)\\nChoose a 52 in (130 cm) fan for anything larger than 225 square feet (20.9 m).\n",
    "Attach the downrod to the fan body.\n",
    "The downrod is the long metal pipe that is used to distance the fan from the ceiling. Keeping the body of the fan on the ground, thread the wires attached to the fan through the downrod. Sit the downrod in place on the top of the fan body. Tighten the locking screws around the base of the downrod until it is securely attached to the fan body. If you’re unsure about the way your specific fan is constructed and put together, check the manufacturer's instructions for more advice. Some fans may have multiple locking screws to hold the downrod in place. Make sure you tighten all of them to prevent the downrod and the fan body from disconnecting when mounting the fan. There are a few factors that can change the required length for your downrod. If your roof is angled, you will need to use a downrod to prevent the fan blades from hitting the roof. If your ceilings are taller than 8 feet (2.4 m), you should use a downrod that is at least 10 inches (25 cm) long to get the best air circulation. If you have a ceiling less than 9 feet (2.7 m) high, you should use a hugger ceiling fan kit, specially designed for lower ceilings. These will have a much shorter downrod, or may not have a downrod at all, allowing them to sit as close to the ceiling as possible.\n",
    "Lift the fan up to the ceiling.\n",
    "Use a ladder or step-ladder to carefully lift the fan assembly up towards the ceiling. Most fans will have some method to suspend them just below the ceiling while you connect the wiring. If your fan does not, ask someone else to hold the fan in place as you do so. It may be easiest to climb up the ladder and get a friend to pass the fan up to you. Make sure your ladder is secure and that you can stand on it safely with a friend if you need to. If at any point you don't feel safe, call a licensed electrician to help.\n",
    "Connect the neutral wires.\n",
    "The neutral wire provides a return path for the current coming into the fan, and will usually have a white insulate covering. Hold the two neutral wires together and twist the stripped ends together. Use a plastic wire connector to hold them together and secure it with electrical tape. Wiring schemes will vary between different ceiling fans. Check the manufacturer’s guide if your wires differ, or call a licensed electrician.\n",
    "Connect the ground wires.\n",
    "The ground wire will usually be green or entirely bare, and is used to prevent electrical shocks. Find the two ground wires, twist them together and secure with a plastic wire connector. Use electrical tape to keep the wires and the connector in place. Make sure the ground wire coming from the ceiling is attached to the ground screw in your fan box, as this connection is crucial for the ground wire to serve its purpose. If you don’t have a ground screw, or you don’t know how to ground a wire, call a licensed electrician.\n",
    "Connect the remaining wires together.\n",
    "Any remaining wires will be hot wires, used to provide power to the fan and any light fittings attached to it. These will usually be black, but may be a different color in different wiring schemes. Twist the remaining wires together and secure them with a plastic wire connector and electrical tape. This method will make one switch control the fan and any light fittings that are a part of it. Look to your manufacturer’s guide for advice on wiring for other control methods, or consult an electrician.\n",
    "Tuck the wires into the fan box.\n",
    "Carefully push the wires coming from the ceiling back into the fan box to secure them. As you do, make sure the wire connectors and electrical tape stay secure and no wiring is exposed. Exposed wiring could lead to a dangerous short-circuit and further issues. If you see any exposed wiring, immediately secure it and cover it fully.\n",
    "Mounting the Fan\n",
    "Screw the canopy over the fan box.\n",
    "The canopy will lift up from the downrod and cover the wiring and socket used to hold the fan in place. Use the provided screws to secure the canopy to the fan box and keep the fan together.\n",
    "Attach the fan blades.\n",
    "One by one, lift the fan blades up to their mountings on the fan motor. Slot them into place according to the manufacturer’s guide, and use the provided screws to tightly secure them to the motor. Make sure the screws are as tight as you can make them. Loose screws will cause the fan blades to wobble and potentially come loose as the fan is running.\n",
    "Install any light fixtures.\n",
    "Many fans will have space for a light fixture on the underside. These will usually be very simple to wire up and secure into place. Check your manufacturer’s guide for instructions on how to install the lighting fixture into your specific fan. The wiring for the lighting fixture will generally follow similar rules as wiring the fan. Connect the wires of the same color together and secure with connectors and electrical tape to prevent short-circuiting.\n",
    "Turn the power back on and test your fan.\n",
    "Go back to the circuit breaker box or boxes and restore power the necessary sections of your home. Turn the fan on at the wall and watch it for a few minutes to make sure it is working as intended.\n",

    "Wood Paneling makes a room look comfortable, and is great in a den. However, there is not too much you can do with wood paneling to make the room look different, and after awhile, you get tired of looking at the same walls.  Wallpaper will cover the Wood Panel, so start looking for your choice of wallpaper and paste it on your wall, by yourself.\n",

Some paperers use a spray bottle of water or a wet sponge. Set the strip of paper, adhesive toward the wall, working from top to bottom, aligning vertically. Smooth the paper to the wall with a dry brush or dry towel. Do not set any wrinkles. Smooth trapped air bubbles to edge of paper to escape. Wet the back of the paper after cutting, apply on the wall as before. Align to first strip. If you cannot get adjoining edges to line up perfectly, it is better to overlap them slightly than to leave a gap between them.\n",

    "###\n",
    "How to Install Ground Rods\n",
    "Ground rods are an important part of having a safe electrical system. They create a route for stray electricity, which occurs during a short or other malfunction, to have a efficient route out of a building. To begin installation, you need to find an appropriate location to install them and then drive them into the ground. Once the rods are in the ground, then you need to ensure that they are connected to the electrical system they are grounding correctly. With a bit of planning and care, you can install grounding rods for a new electrical panel or for an existing panel in order to minimize the threat of electrical fire and injury.\n",
    "Picking the Location\n",
    "Install the rod in a location near the electrical panel.\n",
    "Ground rods need to be installed in the ground outside in a spot where they can be hammered 8 feet (2.4 m) into the ground. There is no requirement for how close or far from a building they should go, but be sure to pick a spot that is convenient to get to and where you will have space to use tools to drive the rod into the ground. If a grounding rod is too close to a building foundation, it could interfere with it. Because of this, it's best to keep it at least 2 feet (0.61 m) from the side of the building.\n",
    "Plan the route for the grounding electrode conductor.\n",
    "Once a ground rod is driven into the ground, it will need to be connected to the electrical panel inside. This is done with a wire called the grounding electrode conductor. It's important to factor its route in when picking a spot for the ground rod. Make sure the grounding cable can easily be routed to the panel from where the grounding rod is positioned. If you have an idea of where you would like to drill a hole in your building to get the conductor inside, pick a spot for the grounding rod nearby.\n",
    "Avoid locations where the ground is mostly rock or heavily compacted.\n",
    "Because you have to drive the rod 8 feet (2.4 m) into the ground, you want to avoid areas that are excessively rocky. While you wont always be able to avoid rocks or know they are there, avoid picking an area that you know is full of rocks.\n",
    "Locate any wires or pipes in the path of the ground rod.\n",
    "Once you have picked a spot to put your ground rod, you need to make sure you will not damage anything in the ground when you install it. In many countries, there are hotlines you can call to have your utilities located free of charge. In the US, for example, there is a national hotline that you can call in order to notify your utilities that you need a locator. It usually takes about 2-3 days for the utilities to come and do the locating, so plan ahead. If there is no locating hotline in your areas, you can call the utility companies directly that serve the building and ask them to locate their underground lines.\n",
    "Putting the Rod in the Ground\n",
    "Purchase an approved grounding rod.\n",
    "Grounding rods need to made of specific conductive metals and they need to made to a specific length and width. Because of this, it's best to buy a rod that is specifically made for this use. Buying a listed rod, meaning it has been verified by a certification group, will ensure that your grounding rod is the correct size and material. Most home improvement and hardware stores stock approved grounding rods. In the US, ground rods need to be at least 8 feet (2.4 m) long. If they are listed, they need to be at least ⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) wide and they will have a mark that says they are listed. If they are not listed, they need to be at least ⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) wide. A listed ground rod will have a marking near the top of it that states that it is approved. The mark allows an electrical inspector to immediately know you have used a proper rod.\n",
    "Start digging a hole with a shovel or post-hole digger.\n",
    "Because a ground rod is so long, it can be hard to get leverage on the top of it when you start installing it. To get the top down to a more manageable level, dig a hole 2–4 feet (0.61–1.22 m) deep. By putting the end of the ground rod in the hole, it will be easier to start hammering the top of the rod. If you don't want to dig a hole or you can't for some reason, you will need a ladder or step stool to get up high enough to start pounding in the top of the ground rod.\n",
    "Drive the rod into the ground.\n",
    "Using your hammer, drill, or driving tool, gradually drive the rod vertically into the ground. You need to drive your rod all the way into the ground. The electrical code states that it must have 8 feet (2.4 m) of contact with the ground, so you need to drive it all the way down. Driving a ground rod into the ground can take a long time and can be difficult work. If you can find someone to take turns driving the rod, it will make for a much easier job. Some electrical inspectors will allow you to leave 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) sticking up out of the ground. However, some want the entire thing covered in earth.\n",
    "Connecting the Rod\n",
    "Pull the grounding electrode conductor to the grounding rod.\n",
    "Once the grounding rod has been driven into the ground, you need to connect it to the electrical system of the building. Pull the grounding electrode conductor up to the top of the grounding rod, making sure it is long enough to make a permanent connection between them. Give the grounding electrode a little bit of slack, so it's not extremely tight where it connects with the grounding rod. This will ensure that if it gets hit or pushed on, it won't get dislodged from the grounding rod. If the grounding electrode conductor has a sheath on it, the last ⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) should be cut off, exposing the wire.\n",
    "Clamp the grounding electrode conductor to the grounding rod.\n",
    "There are specific clamps that are used to connect grounding electrode conductors to grounding rods. You will need 1 clamp. Put the end of the conductor and the end of the rod inside of the clamp and turn the screw on the clamp to press them together securely. These clamps are sold in home improvement and hardware stores.\n",
    "Connect the grounding electrode conductor to the ground bus.\n",
    "The ground bus is where all the ground and neutral wires are attached in the electrical panel. To make the connection, slide the end of the grounding electrode conductor through one of the holes in the bus and tighten the screw in that hole until it holds the wire very tightly. In some cases, the ground wires will be connected to the ground bus and the neutral wires are connected to the neutral bus. These 2 bars are then connected with a main bonding jumper. If this is the case, you can attach your grounding electrode conductor wherever it fits on either bus. You need to be very careful when you are doing any work in an electrical panel. Make sure that your fingers, tools, and the grounding electrode conductor don't make contact with the energized bars in the panel, which are located behind the circuit breakers. If you are unsure about how to make this connection safely, hire an electrician to do the work.\n",

    "How to Machine Sew on a Button\n",
    "Some people prefer to hand sew buttons because it seems difficult to sew them on with a sewing machine, but the process is easier than you might think. It helps to have a special button attachment for your sewing machine, but you can still sew on buttons even if you don’t have one. Using your sewing machine to sew on buttons can cut your sewing time in half and result in a much more durable garment.\n",
    "Adjusting Your Sewing Machine\n",
    "Gather your materials.\n",
    "Using your sewing machine to sew on buttons is easy, but you will need some special materials and tools to get started. To sew buttons onto a piece of clothing, you will need to have:\\nbuttons\\ngarment you want to sew buttons onto\\nsewing machine\\nbutton attachment or some tape\n",
    "Add button attachment or tape.\n",
    "If you have a button attachment, then you can slide that piece onto your sewing machine foot. Depending on the design of your sewing machine, you may need to remove the foot before you can use the button attachment. Check your machine user guide to be sure. If you do not have a button attachment, then you can just hold the button in place on your garment using a bit of tape or by pressing the button down with the ankle of the machine. To use tape, place the button on your garment wherever you want it to go. Then, apply two pieces of tape along the edges of the button. The tape should hold your button in place as you sew.\n",
    "Set stitch type to zigzag and stitch width to zero.\n",
    "Once your button is in place, you will need to check the position of your needle. But before you do this, make sure that your stitch type is set to zigzag and the stitch width is set to zero. Setting your machine to the zigzag stitch is important because the needle has to go back and forth through he button holes. You will likely need to adjust the width before you can begin sewing the button, so do not begin sewing yet.\n",
    "Check the stitch width.\n",
    "After you have your machine on the proper settings, use the hand crank on your machine to slowly move the needle down towards your garment. However, do not push the needle down all the way. Just look to see where the needle would come down if you turned the crank all the way. Then, use this position to help you adjust your stitch width. Increase the stitch width a little at a time until the needle is coming down right over the button holes on both sides of the button. When the position looks correct, then you will be ready to sew. Keep in mind that if you have an advanced machine with a button setting, then checking the stitch width may not be necessary, but it is still a good idea.\n",
    "Drop “feed dogs.” The teeth on the plate of your sewing machine are also known as the “feed dogs.” These teeth help to move your fabric along as you sew.\n",
    "Since you do not want the fabric to move while you sew on a button, it is best to drop the teeth before you start sewing. With some sewing machines, the teeth will drop automatically when you select the button function. However, if your machine does not have a button function or if the teeth do not go down when you select the button function, then you will need to lower them manually. Check your user guide for instructions on how to do this.\n",
    "Sewing on the Button\n",
    "Check the position of your button on the garment.\n",
    "Before you start sewing, make sure that your button is exactly where you want it to be on the garment. Double check the position to be sure. You may even want to place a couple of pieces of clear tape on either side of the button to ensure that it will not move from this position. You can also use a water soluble marker or some tailor’s chalk to mark where you want your button to go. Just position your button and then draw four dots around the edges of your button. You can refer to these dots as you sew the button in place. If you are sewing on multiple buttons, then you may want to position all of them at once. You can use a ruler to ensure that they are in a straight line.\n",
    "Begin stitching slowly.\n",
    "It is important to go slowly when sewing on a button with a sewing machine, or your needle may come down onto the button instead of going through the button hole. If this happens, then your needle is likely to break. Apply gentle pressure to the foot pedal of your machine. You can also turn the wheel on your sewing machine to stitch by hand if you are worried about breaking your needle. Make sure that you stitch through the holes in the button several times. Go in and out of the holes and garment cloth several times to ensure that the button is securely attached. The button may seem a bit tight when you are done, but it will loosen up over time.\n",
    "Cut excess thread.\n",
    "After you have sewn on the button, you will need to cut the excess thread from your button. There will be a piece in the front of the button and in the back of the garment cloth. Use the loop in the back of the garment cloth to pull the front piece through to the back. Trim both pieces of thread so that you only have about four inches of thread extending from the button. You may also want to tie a knot in the end of the thread for security. If you have gone through the button several times with thread, then it should stay in place for a long time, but it will loosen up eventually and a knot may prevent the button from falling straight off. If the thread will not easily pull through to the other side, then you can also thread it through a needle and then insert the needle through the fabric underneath the button. Then, pull the thread through to the other side of the fabric.\n",
    "Sew on additional buttons or sew through extra holes.\n",
    "After you have completed this first button, you can repeat the process with any other buttons that you need to sew onto your garment. If the button that you are sewing on has four holes, then you will need to rotate the fabric and repeat the process on the other two holes. You should be able to use the same settings, but always check by hand cranking the wheel first.\n",

    "###\n",
    "How to Reset a Breaker\n",
    "Most modern houses have circuit breakers to regulate and manage the flow of electricity into the home. When a breaker gets overloaded or shorts to the ground, it can cause a power outage in certain parts of your house. A tripped main breaker will even cut power off to the entire house. If power goes out to one part of your house, flipping the tripped breaker will turn it back on unless the circuit needs repairs. If the power stops working in your entire house, resetting the main breaker may solve your problem. Never attempt to do any repairs to your breaker panel without the help of a certified electrician.\n",
    "Flipping a Tripped Breaker\n",
    "Locate the breaker panel in your home.\n",
    "You can usually find it in the basement of your house or in a utility closet. The breaker panel will look like a large, rectangular box mounted on the wall with thick wires heading into it. Breaker panels are often painted grey with a black latch on the lid. You can often find the breaker panel on the opposite side of the exterior wall that the power line runs into.\n",
    "Check your hands for moisture.\n",
    "Wipe your hands on your pants, shirt, or a towel to make sure they aren’t wet at all. Breaker panels manage and distribute a great deal of electricity. Touching them with wet hands increases your chances of being shocked. You can wear rubber gloves to ensure there’s no moisture on your hands, but it isn’t considered necessary. Err on the side of caution and dry your hands if you think they are even slightly damp.\n",
    "Stand to one side of the panel.\n",
    "If anything were to go wrong with the breaker panel, standing off to one side could prevent your body from taking the brunt of any sparks or electrical charge it releases. Most panels open from left to right, so standing to the left of the panel will often give you the best visibility with the lid open. While breakers are rather safe, small precautions like this could save your life if anything were to go wrong. You don’t need to be far off to the side, just aligned so your body isn’t directly in front of the panel.\n",
    "Open the breaker panel lid with one hand.\n",
    "Never touch the breaker panel with two hands at once, or you could create a circuit with your body that allows current to pass through. Instead, reach out with just your dominant hand and release the latch on the breaker panel lid. Most panel latches can be released by pressing them up slightly and then pulling the lid out toward yourself. The lid is on hinges and will swing open.\n",
    "Look for any switch that is fully or partially tripped.\n",
    "All of the breaker switches that are still functioning properly will be switched to the side that says \\\"on.\\\" The tripped breaker won't be all the way \\\"on,\\\" but it might not be all the way to the \\\"off\\\" side. If any of the switches are even slightly misaligned with the rest (moved slightly toward the center), then they are no longer allowing electricity to flow through them. A barely flipped switch and a completely flipped switch will both have the same effect on the flow of electricity through your house. Look closely at the switches and how they align with one another. There may be more than one that’s been thrown.\n",
    "Refer to the breaker diagram if you need help finding the tripped switch.\n",
    "If you’re still having trouble finding the flipped breaker switch, look on the inside of the breaker panel lid for the diagram. The electrician that installed the breaker panel should have written which switches power different rooms or portions of the house. Read the diagram to find the portion of the house that has lost power and use that to find the switch associated with it. If there is no diagram, you will have to rely on finding the flipped switch visually.\n",
    "Call an electrician immediately if the breaker panel feels hot.\n",
    "Breaker panels should never feel hot to the touch. If you feel heat coming off of the panel as you’re looking for the flipped switch, step away from the breaker immediately and call a certified electrician. If the breaker panel starts making any loud noises, you should also call an electrician. Never, under any circumstances, open a breaker panel up to try to diagnose issues yourself. You should always have the help of a certified electrician when trying to work on your house’s electrical system.\n",
    "Flip the switch all the way to the \\\"off\\\" side.\n",
    "Once you’ve found the flipped switch, use one hand to turn it all the way off. Most breaker switches won’t allow you to turn them back on until they have been completely shut off. Grip the switch with the thumb and index finger of one hand and flip it all the way to the \\\"off\\\" side. Remember, do not touch the panel with both hands at once.\n",
    "Turn the switch all the way back to the \\\"on\\\" side.\n",
    "Once the switch is all the way off, use the same two fingers to flip it back to the \\\"on\\\" side. This will allow power to flow through it once again. As soon as you flip the switch back \\\"on,\\\" the power should return to the part of the house where it was out. If the power doesn't come back on after you flip the switch, your circuit likely needs repairs. Remember to look for multiple switches that may have been thrown. You may need to turn more than one on.\n",
    "Check to ensure the power is working.\n",
    "Check the part of the house that the power had been out in. The lights and outlets should now be working again. If they are not, you may have flipped the breaker for the wrong portion of the house. Go back to the breaker panel and examine it again for any other flipped breaker switches. If power still doesn’t flow to the part of the house, you will need the assistance of an electrician.\n",
    "Resetting a Main Breaker\n",
    "Find the breaker panel.\n",
    "In most houses, the breaker panel can be found it either the basement or a utility closet near the kitchen, laundry room, or bathroom. The panel itself looks like a large, rectangular steel box with thick wires running into it. The panel can usually be found on the opposite side of the exterior wall the power lines connect to.\n",
    "Stand to the side of the panel.\n",
    "If the breaker panel is damaged or failing, there’s a risk that you could be injured. Standing to one side of the panel reduces the chances that any sparks or debris could hit you if something were to go wrong. Breaker panels are very safe, but small safety precautions can mean the difference between life and death in unlikely situations.\n",
    "Make sure your hands are dry.\n",
    "Wipe your hands off on your pants, shirt, or a towel if they’re moist at all. It’s not safe to touch a breaker panel with moisture on your hands because it could make your hands more conductive and increase the likelihood of shock or electrocution. Wearing work gloves can alleviate this concern but aren’t considered a necessary safety measure. If you’re not sure if your hands are dry enough, wipe them off one more time for safety.\n",
    "Open the panel lid using only one hand.\n",
    "Reach out to the release on the panel lid with your dominant hand and slide it up to release the latch. Then simply swing the lid open on its hinges. The panel lid will open like a door. Never touch the breaker panel with both hands at once.\n",
    "Turn off every breaker one by one.\n",
    "Use your thumb and index finger to flip the top left breaker switch all the way to the \\\"off\\\" side, then work your way down to the switch below it and so forth. Keep going until you have flipped every switch to the \\\"off\\\" position. Flip the switches one by one. Some switches may be connected to one another. Those are fine to flip together.\n",
    "Locate the main breaker near the electric meter if it’s not in the panel.\n",
    "The main breaker is often at the very bottom of the breaker panel and labeled. However, in some cases, it may be located in another panel near the electric meter on the outside of your house. If you don’t see it in the breaker panel, go outside and find your power meter. Then locate the panel it’s connected to. The power meter and panel are located where the power lines connect to the external wall of your house. Do not touch the meter itself.\n",
    "Pull open the main breaker lid with one hand, if necessary.\n",
    "Release the latch on the main breaker’s lid by sliding it up with one hand. Then pull the lid open on its hinges just like you would open a small door. Do not touch the main breaker panel with two hands at any time. Do not attempt to do this in the rain. Wait until it’s dry to open the main breaker’s lid.\n",
    "Flip the main breaker to \\\"off\\\" and then back to \\\"on.\\\"\n",
    "The main breaker will be the only switch inside its panel if it's separate from the breaker panel itself. Locate the switch in either place and use your thumb and index finger to flip the switch all the way to “off,\\\" and then back to “on.”\\nAlthough you switched it back to “on,” this often won’t reset the main breaker, and your house will still be without power. Remember, even if the power comes back on, all of the individual breakers are still off, so the lights won’t come on.\n",
    "Turn the breaker off and on one more time.\n",
    "Many breakers need to be turned off and on again twice to be reset. Flip the switch all the way to the \\\"off\\\" side again, then back to the \\\"on\\\" side and leave it at the “on” setting. The power should now be flowing in your house again. You won’t know if this worked until you turn all the individual breakers in the breaker panel itself back on. Close the lid on the main breaker panel if it’s outdoors at this point.\n",
    "Go back to your breaker panel if separate from the main breaker.\n",
    "Make your way back into the house and down to the breaker panel. Remember to use a flashlight if it’s too dark to see in your house. Stand to one side and open the lid just as you have before. Remember to make sure your hands are dry and only to touch the panel with one hand at a time.\n",
    "Flip each switch back to on, one at a time.\n",
    "Start at the top and work your way down. As each switch is flipped, the power should be restored to that portion of the house. If the power does not come back on at this point, there may be an issue with the flow of electricity into the house. Contact your power company to help determine if power is not reaching your home breaker panel. If the lights do come back on, close the panel back up.\n",

    "How to Replace the Plug on a Lamp\n",
    "Over time, the cord around the lamp plug may get damaged and stop working. If you have a damaged lamp plug, try to replace it as soon as possible to reduce the risk of shock or electrical fire. Luckily replacing the old plug only takes a few minutes of work and supplies you can get from your local hardware store. Be sure to pay attention to which wires connect to the prongs so you’re able to attach them correctly to the new plug.\n",
    "Stripping the Old Plug and Cord\n",
    "Unplug the lamp from the outlet.\n",
    "Turn off the lamp at the switch for added protection against electrical shock. Grab the base of the plug and pull it straight out from the wall outlet. Avoid touching the prongs since they may still have a small charge left in them. Never cut a cord while it’s still plugged in, or else you could get seriously injured from electrical shock. If there’s damage on the power cord near the plug, wear rubber insulated gloves so you don’t have to touch any exposed wires.\n",
    "Cut the old plug and 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) of the cord with a utility knife.\n",
    "Measure 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) down from the plug and carefully slice through the cord with a utility knife. Make the cut as straight as possible so you’re less likely to fray the wires. Throw away the old plug as soon as you cut it off. If you have trouble cutting the cord with a utility knife, try using a pair of scissors instead.Tip: If there are cracks, holes, or frays anywhere else on the cord, remove the damaged section as well.\n",
    "Separate the wires on the last 1 in (2.5 cm) of the cord.\n",
    "Look for the thinner section of insulation running through the middle of the lamp cord. Make a ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) cut in the middle of the cord, making sure you don’t damage any of the internal wires. Hold onto the each side of the cord and gently pull it apart until you separate 1 inch (2.5 cm). If your lamp cord doesn’t have a thin piece of insulation running down the middle, carefully slice through the cord’s insulation to expose 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the wires inside of it.\n",
    "Remove ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) of insulation off of each wire with wire strippers.\n",
    "Grip one of the wires in the jaws on a pair of wire strippers so it’s ⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the end. Squeeze the handles together to clamp down on the insulation and pull the strippers toward the end of the cord. Throw away the piece of insulation that comes off of the wire. Repeat the process on the other wire so they’re both exposed. If your lamp has a third wire for a grounding port, strip it as well.\n",
    "Twist the frayed ends of the exposed wires so they’re easier to attach.\n",
    "Grip the exposed end on one of the wires and squeeze together any frayed ends. Rotate them clockwise so they form into a solid wire that doesn’t fray. Repeat the process for the other wire on the power cord. Don’t twist the 2 wires together since you won’t be able to attach them to the plug.\n",
    "Wiring the New Plug\n",
    "Get a polarized replacement plug for your lamp.\n",
    "Opt for a replacement plug that has 1 prong that’s wider than the other since it provides the most protection against electrical overload. Avoid using non-polarized plugs, or plugs where the prongs have the same width, since they aren’t up to electrical code. Choose a plug that has a similar color to the lamp’s power cord so it doesn’t clash. You can buy polarized replacement plugs from your local hardware store. If your original lamp plug had a grounding prong, make sure you buy a replacement plug with one as well.\n",
    "Unscrew the back cover from the replacement plug.\n",
    "Use a screwdriver to remove the screws holding the replacement plug together. Pull the plastic cover off of the plug to separate it from the section that contains the prongs and screws. Set the screws aside while you’re working so you don’t misplace them. Some replacement plugs have a hinge rather than a cover. Remove the screw holding the plug together and pull the sides apart to open the hinge.\n",
    "Slide the cover onto the lamp’s cord.\n",
    "Hold the 2 wires from the lamp together so they’re able to fit through the back hole of the cover. Push the cover onto the wires and pull them through to the other side. Keep the cover about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) from the end of the cord while you work so it doesn’t get in the way. If the replacement plug you’re using has a hinge instead of a separate cover, you may skip this step.\n",
    "Secure the wire with ribbed insulation to the plug’s silver neutral screw.\n",
    "Look at the insulation on each wire and find the one that has the ribbed edges, which means it's the neutral wire. Bend the wire into a small hook and put it underneath the silver screw on the replacement plug’s prongs so the wire goes around it clockwise. Tighten the screw with your screwdriver so it firmly presses against the wires. The silver screw connects to the wider prong on a polarized plug, which is the neutral or negative side. If your lamp has 3 wires, then the neutral wire may have white insulation rather than having a ribbed texture.Variation: If neither of the wires has ribbed insulation, then it doesn’t matter which one you attach to the screw.\n",
    "Hook the wire with the smooth insulation on the plug’s brass screw.\n",
    "Locate the wire that has smooth edges along the sides of the insulation, and bend the exposed end into a hook. Put the wire underneath the brass screw on the side of the replacement plug so it wraps around the screw clockwise. Tighten the screw with your screwdriver so the wire has a firm connection. The brass screw connects to the smaller prong, which is the “hot” or positive side. If your lamp has 3 wires, then use the wire that has red or black insulation.\n",
    "Attach the ground wire to the green screw, if your lamp has one.\n",
    "Look for the green wire from the lamp cord and bend a small hook shape on the exposed end. Locate the green screw on the replacement plug and tuck the wire underneath it. Tighten the screw so the wire doesn’t come loose. Most household lamps don’t have a ground wire, but they may if they are industrial-strength lights or use high-wattage bulbs.\n",
    "Screw the plug back onto the cover to hide the wires.\n",
    "Slide the plastic cover back over the ends of the wires and hold it against the prongs. Check the cord to make sure none of the exposed wires stick out from the back of the plug. Place the screws back in the holes and turn them clockwise to tighten them. If you’re using a hinged replacement plug, then guide the cords into the hole at the back of the plug before snapping it closed. Tighten the screw on the plug so it stays closed.\n",
    "Plug in your lamp to test if it turns on.\n",
    "Use an outlet that you know works so you know there aren’t any other electrical problems preventing the lamp from turning on. Plug the lamp into the outlet and switch it on to see if it lights up. If it works, then put the lamp back on its original outlet. If the lamp still doesn’t work, take apart the plug and check that you connected the wires to the correct screws. Switch them if you need to before trying the lamp again. If it still doesn’t work, then there may be a problem with the lamp’s bulb socket instead.\n",

    "How to Prepare a Foundation\n",
    "When beginning a construction project, it is important to take great care in properly setting up the foundation. The success of the project, whether it is a large house or small tool shed, relies heavily on the care and effort that has been put into the site preparation and layout. While the techniques described in this article can be employed to some extent on any scale project, they are tailored to the small to mid-scale home project. This is a basic guidance to a do-it-yourself builder.\n",
    "Determine width and length of foundation dimensions.\n",
    "Measure out one side.\n",
    "Place stakes at each end, oriented as desired. It is important that the stakes lie along the same edge, namely, corners 1 & 2 as shown in Figure 1, not corners 1 & 4. Bang in the stakes using hammer or equivalent tool.\n",
    "Use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine where to place the last two stakes.\n",
    "For a 90° triangle, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 when c is the hypotenuse. Figure 1 shows how this relates to laying out the foundation. Find the distance A using A=sqrt(w^2+l^2).\n",
    "Cut or mark off a piece of string to length A.\n",
    "Lay it out starting at one of the first two corners staked out, more or less along the diagonal line shown in the figure above.\n",
    "Measure the length.\n",
    "From the original corner staked out that is not in contact with the string, measure out the length (or width) perpendicular to the side previously laid out. Hammer in the third stake at the point where the end of the string meets the measured out distance of this side. Note: The point of this step is to ensure that the foundation is square, so adjustment of the angle at which the string and/or side are laid out may be required.\n",
    "Repeat steps 4 & 5.\n",
    "Start at the original stake not already used to anchor the string.\n",
    "Smooth the area.\n",
    "Use the metal rake (and shovel if necessary) to roughly smooth out and level the entire area within the boundaries of the foundation. This step is just to ready the area to be leveled precisely, so don’t spend too much time trying to “eyeball” it.\n",
    "Lay the 2x4 (60 cm x 1.2 meters) along the length of one edge of the foundation.\n",
    "Do this as shown in Figure 2, making sure that no gaps are visible between the ground and the bottom of the 2x4. Note: If the board is shorter than the edge being leveled, place one end of the board at a corner to leave a gap beyond only one end of the board. Do not attempt to center the board.\n",
    "Place the level on top of the 2x4.\n",
    "If the board is level and gap free, skip step 10.\n",
    "Dig out the higher edge underneath the 2x4.\n",
    "Keep the base smooth under the length of the 2x4 so that no gaps form. Do this until the 2x4 is level. If the board is as long as the side being leveled, skip steps 11 & 12.\n",
    "Slide the board along its length.\n",
    "Cover the gap left along the edge being leveled. Leave at least 2-3 feet (60cm - 91 cm) of overlap between ground leveled in step 10 and the 2x4.\n",
    "Repeat steps 9 & 10.\n",
    "Bring the unleveled ground to the same elevation as the area already completed. If there is still a gap of unleveled ground, repeat steps 11 & 12.\n",
    "Level the ground.\n",
    "Use the rake to level the ground in front of the board.\n",
    "Bring the board forward.\n",
    "Bring it 1-3 feet (30.5 cm - 91 cm) as shown in Figure 3, and repeat steps 9-12. Do this all the way to the other side of the foundation. In the area between board placements, use the rake to smooth out the ground, and bring it to the elevation of the area leveled underneath the boards.\n",
    "Repeat steps 8-14 in the perpendicular direction.\n",
    "This means starting along either of the two edges that haven’t been leveled along their lengths. This should be easier than the first pass, as the foundation has already been leveled in one direction.\n",
    "Check that the foundation has been leveled properly.\n",
    "To do this, lay the 2x4 diagonally across the center of the foundation, with each end pointing at opposite corners (the same orientation as the string in the beginning of this process). By placing the level on top, you should be able to confirm that the whole section is level.\n",

    "Measure the width and height of the window opening.\n",
    "Measure the top, the middle, and the bottom of the old window for width. Measure the right side, the left side, and the middle of the old window for height. Triple checking the measurements will ensure that you purchase the correct size window. When purchasing your new vinyl replacement windows, always use the smallest measurements. Otherwise, your window will be too large for the hole.\n",
    "Purchase a replacement window that fits the hole left by the old window.\n",
    "Replacement vinyl windows will have their dimensions clearly marked on the packaging. Purchase a window at a local home-improvement store, and make sure that it has 2 layers of glass for added insulation. For a correct fit, the replacement window should be approximately ⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) narrower than the opening width and height. If your window measurements are in between sizes, round the measurement down. Measure the replacement window in 3 places with a tape measure to confirm that these measurements are correct. This will ensure that it fits in the window opening. If your windows are an unusual size and a corresponding size of replacement window is not in stock at the home-improvement store, ask about custom ordering the vinyl windows.\n",
    "Remove the inside trim, moldings, and stops with a broad chisel.\n",
    "Slip the broad chisel around the edges of the currently installed window. Wiggle the chisel back and forth to loosen the paint and caulking between the window frame and the sashing. Then, pull off the trim and molding. Once you’ve removed the trim and molding, don’t throw it away. Save these items for later use. Not all windows have stops. If yours do not, don’t worry. In this case, you only need to remove the trim and moldings.\n",
    "Remove old cords and weights from the bottom sash.\n",
    "Weights and balances are used on some older models of aluminum or vinyl windows, but not on most modern windows. Carefully remove these items from the frame, using a pair of scissors to cut the cords if needed. You can throw old weights and cords away, since your new window will come equipped with these items.\n",
    "Pry out the parting stops at the top and sides of the window.\n",
    "Using your broad chisel again, pry the stops away from the window frame. Once you've pulled the stops out, set them aside. You'll reinstall them once the replacement window is in place. Be sure not to damage existing stops or openings. Also be careful not to jam your chisel into the window frame, since you’ll install the replacement window in the same location.\n",
    "Remove the top and bottom sashes once the stops are out.\n",
    "The sashes should no longer be held in place against the window frame. Lift out the top sash first by pulling the bottom lip forward and out, away from the lower sash. Remove the bottom sash by pulling its upper lip upwards and outwards, straight towards your body. Dispose of the old sashes once you’ve removed them from the wall.\n",
    "Remove the securing staples that hold the aluminum tracks in place.\n",
    "If the existing window is fitted with aluminum tracks, use a pair of pliers to pull out the staples holding the tracks in place. Once the staples are out, lift out both the window sashes and the aluminum track. If the tracks are held in place with screws, remove the screws using a Philips-head screwdriver, then pull out the tracks.\n",
    "Preparing the Window Opening\n",
    "Scrape off any loose paint or stain.\n",
    "If the old window didn’t come out smoothly, there may be paint remnants and loose caulk or expanding foam stuck to the window jambs. Run a paint scraper along the interior and exterior surfaces of the door jamb. Keep the scraper at about a 30°angle and apply firm pressure to scrape the jambs clean.\n",
    "Make sure that your replacement window fits in the frame.\n",
    "Close and lock the window sashes on the replacement window. Set the new window in the opening to verify that your earlier measurements were correct and the window fits snugly in the opening. Then, remove the window from the opening in your wall. If the replacement window doesn’t fit correctly, return it to the hardware or home-improvement store and purchase the correct size.\n",
    "Fill empty weight cavities with fiberglass insulation.\n",
    "You may find that there are empty cavities on either side of the window frame once you’ve pulled out the old window and removed the cords and weights. If this is the case, stuff fiberglass insulation into these gaps to prevent cold air from building up inside your walls. If you don’t have fiberglass insulation already on hand, you can purchase it by the foot at a local hardware or home-improvement store.\n",
    "Apply caulk to the inside and outside edges of the stool.\n",
    "Visit your local hardware store and purchase 1 tube of professional-grade exterior paintable caulk. Run a thin, even bead of caulk along the edges of the stool where it meets the window apron and the window sill. Also apply caulk to the outside blind-stops and along the top of the opening's header. Caulk will keep the stool of the window from being damaged by water drops. It will also prevent drafts from entering.\n",
    "Positioning the New Window\n",
    "Set the replacement window into the frame opening.\n",
    "Set the bottom of the window in first and lift the rest of the window up into place. To secure the window, butt the exterior window frame up against the opening blind stops. Do this from the interior wall side, and take care not to push the window clear out the other side of the wall. Make sure that the sashes are still locked when you set the window in place.\n",
    "Use a level tool to ensure that the window is level.\n",
    "The replacement window may not sit flat in the window hole as once you’ve set it in place. To determine if it’s level, set a level on the top of the lower sash and look to see if the indicator bubble floats to the center of the tube. Even if the window looks level, it may be off-kilter to a very slight degree. If you don’t have a level, purchase one at a local hardware store. The tool resembles a metal bar that’s roughly 18 inches (46 cm) long.\n",
    "Insert shims beneath the window until it sits flat and opens smoothly.\n",
    "Shims are nearly flat pieces of wood that slightly raise the level of one side of the window. If the installed window doesn’t cleanly open and close or if it’s not level, place 1 shim at a time beneath the low side to raise it up. To secure the frame, also place shims at the middle of the frame and at the middle of the top and bottom sashes. Once the shims are in place and the window is square and opens and closes smoothly, snap off the shim stems.\n",
    "Install shims behind screw holes.\n",
    "This will prevent the frame from becoming warped when you tighten the screws through the window and into the frame. Place shims directly behind the jamb where each screw will be inserted. When you insert the screws, they’ll pass directly through the shims. If the ends of the shims stick out once you’ve screwed the window into place, snap them off.\n",
    "Securing the Window in Place\n",
    "Use screws to secure the window to the opening in your wall.\n",
    "Most replacement vinyl windows are screwed in place. Take your replacement screws and install them through the screw holes in the window sashing. Align the screws with the pre-existing holes in the wooden window frame. Tighten the screws with a screwdriver until they’re firmly in place. The replacement window should have come with screws for installation when you purchased it. So, you won’t need to purchase these screws separately.\n",
    "Install insulation around the window between the frame and opening.\n",
    "Use low-pressure expanding foam made from polyurethane. Shake the can and attach the narrow tube as directed. Stick the point of the tube in the gaps around your installed window, and squeeze the trigger until the gap is filled with foam. Be careful if you’re using traditional expanding foam for the insulation, as installing too much insulation on top and bottom may cause window to bow. Insulation will block drafts and keep the window from letting hot or cold air you’re your home.\n",
    "Reinstall the stops, trim, and molding that you removed earlier.\n",
    "Depending on the style of replacement vinyl windows that you purchased, these items may need to be screwed into place, or they may be held in place by pressure. If they need to be screwed in place, the screws will be included in the replacement window packaging. Work gently with the stops, since they’re relatively delicate and can break easily.\n",
    "Stain or paint the interior surfaces of the window sash and frame.\n",
    "The exterior surface of replacement vinyl windows will already be finished. So, choose a color of stain or paint that you like and apply it to the exposed surfaces of the sash and frame. Wait 8-10 hours for the paint to dry. If the first layer of stain or paint is too translucent for your tastes, apply a second layer.\n",

    "Physical Installation\n",
    "Turn off the power to your doorbell system.\n",
    "Before you can begin the installation process, you will need to shut off the power to your doorbell system to prevent accidental electrocution. Locate your circuit breaker box and switch off the breaker powering your doorbell system. Once the power is shut off, test your old doorbell to be sure there is no power running through the voltage system. If you are unsure which breaker is for your doorbell, try switching the breakers off individually while testing your doorbell to determine the correct breaker.\n",
    "Locate your chime box.\n",
    "Remove the cover to your chime box. You should see at least three wire connectors labeled “TRANS” (transistor), “FRONT” (front door), and “REAR” (rear/side door). Depending on which doorbell you are replacing will decide if you need to use the “FRONT” or “REAR” connector, but you will need to use the “TRANS” connector.\n",
    "Prepare the wires.\n",
    "Remove the wires connected to your chime box that you will be using. Keep track of each wire. Straighten and/or trim the chime wires so there is about ¼ inch of exposed wire at the end.\n",
    "Wire in the Nest Connector.\n",
    "Grab the included Nest Connector and insert the “TRANS” wire into the terminal connected to the grey wire on the Nest Connector. Insert the other wire into the terminal that is connected to the white wire on the Nest Connector. Attach the grey and white wires to their corresponding wire connections on your chime box.\n",
    "Route the wires and replace your chime box cover.\n",
    "Route all wires and mount the Nest Connector neatly. If you have a mechanical chime box, make sure the Nest Connector and any wires are away from any moving components. After, replace your chime box cover.\n",
    "Remove your old bell.\n",
    "Unscrew your old bell. Detach both wires and set the old doorbell aside. Make sure the wires do not fall back inside the hole.\n",
    "Mark the holes for drilling.\n",
    "To mount your Nest doorbell, you will need the included wall mount. With the horizontal screw hole at bottom, hold the bracket in place where the wires are within the bottom half of the center oval of the bracket so they do not interfere with the Nest doorbell when you clip it into place. You can use a level here to ensure the bracket is straight. Using a pencil, mark the wall where the screw holes will need to be drilled.\n",
    "Drill the holes for the mounting bracket.\n",
    "Set the mounting bracket aside. Grab a power drill and drill into the wall where you marked the screw holes. If you are drilling into a masonry material, such as brick, use the included masonry bit and tap the included anchors into the holes. If you are drilling into a softer material such as wood or vinyl, use a 3/32-bit size to create pilot holes for the included screws.\n",
    "Install the mounting bracket.\n",
    "Grab the included screws and install the mounting bracket with the horizontal screw hole at the bottom. Use a level and adjust your bracket using the bottom screw. If needed, use the included 15-degree angle bracket if your Nest doorbell is in a corner or close to a wall. This bracket will ensure your camera view is not impacted from being too close to a wall.\n",
    "Connect the wires to your Nest doorbell.\n",
    "Loosen the screws located on the back of the Nest doorbell so that there is enough space for your wires. Wrap one wire around each of the screws. In this case, it doesn’t matter which wire goes where. Tighten the screws, making sure they are angled towards the bottom of the doorbell. If your wires are too short, use the included wire extensions.\n",
    "Clip in your Nest doorbell.\n",
    "Gently feed the wires back into the wall and clip in your new doorbell. If you ever need to remove the Nest doorbell, push the included key tool into the small hole located at the bottom of the doorbell.\n",
    "Turn the power back on.\n",
    "Check your Nest doorbell. The ring around the button should glow blue which means everything is working correctly. If there is no light, check to see if the wiring in your chime box is correct. If the ring glows orange, this means the voltage system to your doorbell is not strong enough and you will need to contact a professional electrician to upgrade your system.\n",
    "Setting Up\n",
    "Download the Nest App.\n",
    "With the installation complete, download the Nest app from the Google play store or Apple app store onto your mobile device. Create a free Nest account or sign in if you already have an existing account.\n",
    "Add your Nest doorbell.\n",
    "In the Nest app, tap the plus sign to add your device. Scan the QR code located on the envelope that is included in the box. If you are unable to scan the QR code tap “Continue Without Scanning\\\" and type in the six-character code below the QR code.\n",
    "Connect your Nest doorbell to your WiFi network.\n",
    "You will need your mobile device to be connected to your WiFi network and have your WIFI password ready. Once you scan the QR code, the app will then connect to your Nest doorbell. Select your WIFI network and type in your WIFI password. After the Nest doorbell connects to your WIFI network, the app will test the video.\n",
    "Test your doorbell to make sure your chime is working.\n",

    "How to Repair Lead Joint Hub Plumbing Pipe\n",
    "Are you interested in repairing lead pipes that are over 100 years old? When contemplating the repair of a leaking joint in a bell and spigot cast iron soil pipe, sometimes it becomes necessary to repair or to replace the leaking joint in a bell for a variety of reasons; whether you are replacing the leaking joint or repairing it to reduce expenses, cast iron pipes are heavy and require an intensive amount of work to caulk the joints with oakum.\n",
    "Remove the lead and oakum in the leaking joint.\n",
    "This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the location of the joint, its size and the level of your commitment to the process. There are times when one simply MUST do a caulked joint, and times when the quick, cheap, and easy nature of PVC makes the choice a 'no-brainer'.\n",
    "Remove ALL of the material from the joint.\n",
    "It's pretty much impossible to get a leak-free repair from a partial replacement of the original seal.\n",
    "Once the joint is properly prepared (clean and dry, with no residual 'stuff'), fill it with oakum (a tarry hemp fiber), which is packed into the space between bell and spigot using steel instruments called 'caulking irons.'\n",
    "Old screwdrivers make good improvised caulking irons. Pack each with several turns of oakum so as to make a relatively solid joint between the pipes. These layers are continually hammered into the joint, around and around, until there's only one inch of space between the top of the oakum and the rim of the hub.\n",
    "Fill the last space.\n",
    "The remaining one-inch space will be filled with molten lead in one continuous pour, and the surface of the lead hammered around and around the circumference of the joint ensures a solid seal between the iron and the lead. Horizontal joints require the use of a joint runner, which is a non-combustible rope which is clamped around the top of the joint with a space at the top into which the molten lead is poured.\n",
    "Every joint must consist of one inch of lead, all poured at once.\n",
    "Oakum must be hammered so as to compress and seal the gap between pipes. Joint runners permit the pouring of vertical joints in horizontal pipes.\n",

    "How to Repair a Drill Power Cord\n",
    "Drills and other power tools can make a job go easier and more quickly, but damaged tools can be dangerous to use.  Repairing a power cord on a basic electric drill can extend the life of the tool and make it much safer to use.\n",
    "Determine the damage to your tool.\n",
    "The tool in the illustrations has damage caused by misuse or poor tool maintenance, but the problem isn't always this obvious. You can take the following steps to try to determine where the problem is with your drill. Make sure the drill is plugged into a receptacle that has the correct voltage. You might plug a similar tool into the same receptacle to test the power, and if the alternate tool works, you can continue. Inspect the tool and its power cord. Most drills are double insulated, so if you see burnt connectors on the plug, or one is missing, you can assume that this might be causing the problem. Look for damaged insulation or other signs of a problem as well. Smell the drill's motor where the vents are visible. If the internal parts have overheated, there will be a distinct odor of burnt plastic. Hold the trigger in the \\\"on\\\" position and tap the drill lightly, making sure the chuck is in a safe position. Loose wires and bad brushes sometimes will allow the drill to run intermittently when you tap the drill.\n",
    "Make sure that the drill is disconnected from any power source.\n",
    "Remove the drill's switch cover so you can test the wires and motor after you have completed the previous steps. If you have already determined the cord is damaged, you can probably skip the testing steps and proceed with repairs. Test the drill's power cord for continuity with an ohmmeter to determine if the conductors are broken. This can be done by connecting the test leads to the prong on each side and the terminal at the drill's switch. If you read continuity on each wire, you can test the switch itself. Squeeze the trigger while contacting the terminals on each side to see if the circuit through the switch is making a connection.\n",
    "Remove the terminal wires from the switch after you have determined the problem with the tool is in the power cord.\n",
    "Many drills (and other tools) have screw type connections at the switch; these are removed by simply loosening the screws and removing the wires. For stabbed in connections, you might insert a small diameter sharp instrument next to the wire to depress the locking tag that secures the wire, then pull the wire free from the connector.\n",
    "Remove the clamp that secures the power cord to the drill motor housing (this is a stress relief clamp that protects the internal connection).\n",
    "Pull the cord out of the drill housing, and remove the factor boot, or cord protector from it.\n",
    "If the power cord has obvious damage near the drill, you may be able to cut the damaged section from the cord and reuse it, although it will be substantially shorter than when it was new.\n",
    "Find a replacement power cord for the drill.\n",
    "If your drill is double insulated, you need to replace the cord with a two-wire cord the same size as the original; if it is grounded, use a three-wire, three pronged cord for a replacement. Do not use a two wire cord for a grounded tool.\n",
    "Strip the insulation jacket off of about 3 to 5 inches (7.5-12.5cm) of the replacement cord, then strip the conductor insulation back about 3/4 inch (2cm), being careful not to nick or damage the wire strands.\n",
    "Slide the cord boot onto the new cord, letting it slip down several inches from the stripped insulation jacket.\n",
    "Insert the wires into the holes (or clamp them onto the terminals) where the old ones were removed, making sure the same colored wires go on the same terminals.\n",
    "Tighten the clamps/screws tightly if applicable.\n",
    "Re-install the cord clamp and tighten it securely, then slip the cord boot into its slot.\n",
    "Replace the drill switch cover, tightening all of its fasteners snugly.\n",
    "Test the drill to make sure it runs.\n",
    "If it fails to operate, you may find you need to replace the switch or the brushes, but otherwise, you will need to replace the drill.\n",

    "How to Repair Peeling Stucco\n",
    "When applied properly, stucco can last for 100 years or more. However, in some cases it can start to crack and peel off of a wall. This is often because water has seeped into the wall underneath the stucco and caused water damage. Luckily, you can repair cracked and peeling stucco to restore the wall’s strength and appearance. This process does take some time, since you have to apply the stucco in three coats, but it isn’t too complicated. The good news is that when you’re all done, the damaged section of your stucco wall will be waterproofed and should last for years to come!\n",
    "Removing the Loose Stucco\n",
    "Break away loose chunks of stucco with a hammer.\n",
    "Whack away at the loosest pieces of stucco using the head of the hammer until they fall to the ground. Use the claw end of the hammer to pry away any peeling and damaged pieces that you can’t knock off.Warning: Wear eye protection when you are removing the loose stucco so you don’t get any debris in your eyes. This applies to repairing stucco that is severely cracking, buckling, or blistering, causing it to loosen and peel away from the wall. If there are just minor cracks in the stucco, you can fill them with stucco repair caulk. Be careful not to damage any of the wood laths beneath the stucco, which are the wooden strips that hold the stucco in place.\n",
    "Chip away all the loose stucco from the edges of the damaged area.\n",
    "Keep using your hammer to chip and pry loose stucco off the wall all the way around the edges of the peeling area. Stop when you reach stucco that is firmly adhered to the wood laths underneath.Removing all the loose and damaged stucco will leave you with a hole surrounded by stucco that is still good so you can create a solid patch and prevent further damage.\n",
    "Cut away any metal mesh from the hole using metal snips.\n",
    "Metal snips are a type of shears for cutting through various types of metal. Use a pair of these to clip the mesh around the edges of the hole until you can remove a whole piece of it. Take the mesh out of the hole to expose the wood laths underneath.This will allow you to add waterproofing to the wood laths to prevent water damage, which is usually the reason stucco separates from a wall. If the construction is old, there might not be any mesh, in which case you can skip this step.\n",
    "Use a wire brush to clear loose debris out of the hole.\n",
    "Firmly brush the hole out using horizontal and vertical strokes in all directions. Stop when there are no more loose pieces of stucco inside the hole.This will clean off the surface so you can properly waterproof it.\n",
    "Adding Builder’s Paper and Mesh\n",
    "Trim a piece of grade-D builder’s paper to fit the hole using a utility knife.\n",
    "Hold a piece of builder's paper up to the hole in the stucco and trace the outline of the hole. Carefully cut the paper with a utility knife so it fits tightly inside the hole and the edges of the paper meet the edges of the old stucco that is still good.Builder’s paper is Kraft paper that is saturated with waterproofing asphalt. It will create a waterproof layer between the wood laths and the stucco to prevent future peeling.\n",
    "Attach the builder’s paper to the wood laths with roofing nails.\n",
    "Hold the builder’s paper in the hole tightly against the wood laths. Hammer in as many roofing nails as you need to fasten it securely to the wood laths inside the hole.Roofing nails are galvanized and highly rust-resistant, which makes them ideal for attaching the builder’s paper to the wood laths.\n",
    "Repeat the process to add another layer of builder’s paper in the hole.\n",
    "Use your utility knife to trim another sheet of grade-D builder’s paper to fit tightly in the hole. Fasten it in place using roofing nails.This will ensure that the waterproofing is very tightly sealed and durable.\n",
    "Trim a piece of galvanized metal lath to fit in the hole using metal snips.\n",
    "Hold a sheet of galvanized metal lath over the hole. Snip the ribs in the metal lath around the edges of the hole to shape it so it will fit tightly in the hole on top of the carpenter’s paper.Galvanized metal lath is a type of rust-resistant metal mesh used for stuccoing. It helps hold the stucco securely in place.\n",
    "Fasten the metal lath on top of the carpenter’s paper with roofing nails.\n",
    "Place the mesh into the hole on top of the carpenter’s paper. Use your hammer to drive roofing nails through the mesh and the paper below it into the wood laths to secure it in place.Position the nails so that the head of each nail partially covers some of the ribs in the mesh to fasten it securely.\n",
    "Patching the Hole with Base Coats\n",
    "Mix a batch of base coat stucco in a wheelbarrow.\n",
    "Combine 1 part plastic cement with 3 parts masonry sand in a wheelbarrow. Blend the dry ingredients together thoroughly with a mason’s hoe, then stir in water a little at a time until it is the consistency of pudding.There are many different stucco recipes. Feel free to use a different one if you already have your own recipe you like. You can also purchase a pre-mixed stucco base coat and just add the water to it.\n",
    "Slap stucco onto the wire mesh using a brick trowel.\n",
    "Scoop up approximately fist-sized scoops of the stucco on a brick trowel. Sling them onto the galvanized metal lath until it is completely covered.A brick trowel is the kind of trowel that has a pointy, spade-shaped blade.\n",
    "Smooth the base layer stucco out using a finishing trowel.\n",
    "Pack the stucco down with a finishing trowel. Drag the trowel out towards the edges to smooth out the stucco and pack it down until the base layer is about ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) lower than the surrounding old stucco.A finishing trowel is a large, flat, rectangular trowel with a handle on the back. You can alternate between using the brick trowel and finishing trowel as you smooth the stucco out. Do whatever is easiest and most comfortable for you.\n",
    "Scratch the surface of the stucco using a trowel when it isn’t shiny anymore.\n",
    "Wait until the smooth stucco starts to lose it’s wet-looking sheen, which can take from 30-90 minutes. Use the edge of a trowel to score the surface all over with long lines or X-shaped marks.This will help the next layer bond to the base layer better.\n",
    "Cover the base layer with plastic for 7 days.\n",
    "Tape a sheet of plastic over the patched area and let it cure for 7 days. Remove the plastic after a week, mist it with water, and proceed.The plastic keeps the moisture in the base layer from evaporating too fast, which can weaken the stucco.\n",
    "Repeat the process to add another layer of base layer stucco.\n",
    "Mix up another batch of base coat stucco using the exact same recipe you did for the first. Apply it using your brick trowel, then pack it down and smooth it out until it is just barely lower than the edges of the surrounding stucco using your finishing trowel. Score the surface of the second coat when it loses its wet sheen, then tape plastic over it again, but leave it for just 3 days.Adding stucco in 3 layers will ensure that it cures properly so it’s strong and long-lasting.\n",
    "Applying the Finish Coat\n",
    "Remove the plastic sheet after 3 days and mist the second coat.\n",
    "Let the second coat of stucco cure for just 3 days this time. Take off the plastic sheet after 3 days, mist it with water to moisten it, and proceed.\n",

    "Pour 1 part plastic cement and 4 parts masonry sand into a wheelbarrow and blend everything together with a mason’s hoe. Add water a little at a time, stirring as you go, until it is a pudding-like consistency.You can use a pre-mixed stucco finish coat if you want and just add water. The finish coat just has more sand than the base coat.\n",
    "Apply the finish coat using your brick trowel.\n",
    "Fill the patch in with the finish coat stucco up to the level of the surrounding old stucco. Smooth it out and blend it in around the edges by dragging your trowel out across the surrounding stucco.Stucco can have many different textures, so you can experiment to give the finish coat the look that you want. For example, if the old stucco has prominent blobs of texture, try scooping up tiny bits of stucco on the tip of your trowel and flicking them against the patch to give it more texture.\n",
    "Wait 60-90 days before painting the patched stucco.\n",
    "The average drying time for stucco is 90 days, but it may dry faster if the conditions are warm and dry. Wait at least 60 days if you are in a hot, dry climate, and about 90 days if you are in a humid or cold and moist climate.Even if the stucco feels dry and hard to the touch, it can still be in the process of curing. The drying process goes very slowly, which is what makes stucco durable, so don’t rush into painting it.\n",

    "How to clean a flat panel monitor A flat panel monitor requires some extra care when cleaning. Since the surface is antistatic and softer than a glass panel CRT monitor, using improper cleaning methods can cause damage, such as scratches, etching or cloudiness The other parts of the monitor such as the frame and stand are also made of material that needs to be cleaned differently than other household items. Learn how to clean a flat panel monitor properly to protect your investment and maintain a crisp, clear view. Keep it clean to avoid dust and grime buildup. Purchase a soft cotton cleaning cloth for maintenance. Microfiber cloths designed for cleaning electronics are available at department stores, electronics departments and office supply stores. Other soft materials that can be used include soft, worn cotton or flannel. Paper towels or unwashed, new cloth is too abrasive for the surface. Keep the cleaning cloth in a dust free area. The cloth should be dedicated for use on the flat screen monitor only. Using it on other items can pick up dirt and debris that can scratch the surface or spread dirt. Remove any powder that appears on the monitor during shipping. This can easily be removed with the soft cloth. Use the cloth to wipe up smudges and fingerprints as needed. To keep away dust, establish a routine of wiping the monitor at least once a week. Wipe the cloth across the screen. Move it from one side to the other, in one direction, from the top of the screen to the bottom. Do not rub at an area of the screen or apply pressure. Dampen the cloth with water to clean more stubborn streaks or smudges. Wring it out thoroughly so that it is slightly damp, not wet Use this to clean the surface of the screen as well as the plastic casing of the monitor. Make a cleaning solution to clean the flat screen monitor.This will help to get rid of grime or marks that cannot be removed with dry wiping or a damp cloth. Mix 1 part diluted isopropyl alcohol to 1 part water Spray the solution on the cloth only, never directly on the monitor. Alternatively, you can purchase a commercial cleaner at an electronics or computer store. Use care around the monitor. Do not touch it with fingers, pens, pencils or other sharp objects. Be careful with food or liquid that could splash the monitor. Teach children not to touch the monitor. Tell others how to clean a flat panel monitor if you have other household members or outside cleaning help, make sure they know how to properly clean the monitor. Regular household cleaners should never be used on the monitor screen or frame most are too abrasive and can cause scratching or fading. Window cleaners like Windex contain ammonia which can cause etching and cloudiness. \n",
